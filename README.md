**LICENSE NOTE:** This codebase currently has **NO license** in accordance to the definition thereof as specified by GitHub *(see the definition provided [here](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/) for more info)*. This is for a number of reasons:
* **This app is still very much under construction** (as with `PrEis` and all sibling apps); and
* **I'm not expecting anyone besides myself to be utilizing this codebase** at the moment; and
* **I published this codebase for career purposes** WRT showcasing my software development abilities; analogous to my `P5JS` live code demos repo `BROADGATE` which can be accessed [here](https://seiselen.github.io/codingProjects.html) and whose repo is linked [here](https://github.com/seiselen/PROJECT-BROADGATE).
* **Effecting a license is not necessarily reversible**; i.e. it'd be dishonest and frankly stupid to do so and then later declare *"this codebase is unlicensed and private again, tee hee!"*. Ergo I'm keeping it private until there's a good reason not to! ðŸ˜€
* **That Said**, and as with the `BROADGATE` codebase: **folks are welcome to view, fork, and play around with the code** *(within, of course, the aforementioned constraints)*.
